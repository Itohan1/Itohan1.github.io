            I was inspired by a friend who felt that he didn't have a chance in the professional space and was in search of the right mentor. A lot of mentors out there are passionate about ushering driven individuals into their career world. I wanted to create a space where a mentee could proudly identify themselves as beginners and meet other individuals doing so.
